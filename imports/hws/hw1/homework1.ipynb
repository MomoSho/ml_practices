Feature correlation is useful for feature selection and understanding the relationship between multiple variables within a dataset. Correlation is either positive, negative, or zero. When two features increase simultaneously, they are positively correlated. When one feature increases while the other decreases, the features are negatively correlated. Zero correlation is when there is no relationship between the features. Correlation is on the range -1 (perfect negative correlation) and 1 (pefect positive correlation).  \n",
